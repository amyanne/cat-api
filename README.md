<h4> Cat Rescue App is an API that allows for a cat rescue to upload pictures and descriptions of cats available for adoption </h4>
<h2> Features </h2> 
<ul>
  <li>Upload pictures and descriptions of cats</li>
  <li>Filter cats in alphabetical order</li>
</ul>
<h2> Tech Stack </h2>
<h3> Backend </h3
<ul>
  <li>Ruby [2.6.1]</li>
  <li>Rack-Cors</li>
</ul>
<h3> Frontend </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Vanilla JavaScript [ES6]</li>
  <li>Custom CSS3 styling</li>
</ul>
<h2> Challenges </h2>
Learning how to fetch data correctly was the most challenging part of this project. Properly sending the personality traits array (from checked boxes on the from) and have them be connected to both a cat and a personality trait was the hardest issue I faced. To overcome this, I researched how to build a custom accepts_nested_attributes. I learned how precise I needed to be with my naming conventions for the backend and frontend to effectively communicate. The built in debugger feature in JavaScript was very useful in figuring out how to use the array and display it. Console.log statements were useful in figure out the issues in the backend. 
<h2> Future Implementation </h2>

<ul>
  <li>User sign up and login</li>
  <li>Admin sign and login</li>
  <li>Edit and Delete feature for cats</li>
  <li>A contact form for users to send the admin a message</li>
</ul>
